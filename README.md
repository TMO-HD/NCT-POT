# NCT Thesaurus (NCT-T) and NCT Data Space (NCT-DS)
Ontology for Precision Oncology Workflows at the National Center of Tumor Diseases Heidelberg

# Target
The NCT aims to support precision oncology workflows by providing: 
1. **NCT Data Space**: A data concept for organizing both non-patient-related data and patient-related data for precision oncology workflows. 
2. **NCT Thesaurus**: An ontology embracing a growing number of data domains relevant for precision oncology workflows, e.g. clincal information regarding diagnoses, diagnostics and therapies as well as (molecular)biological/pharmaceutical like drugs (and their classes), drug targets, molecular alterations etc. It integrates both establishes external taxonomies and self-maintained

## NCT-T: Manual Curation
Data from all sources is periodically updated (usually monthly) from their primary sources and integrated into the NCT-T, thereby updating the NCI-T master tables. Links between different data domains are manually curated by a team of dedicated scientist and oncologists actively involved in precision oncology workflows within the NCT network.
