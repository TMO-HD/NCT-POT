Upon oral administration, PRMT5 inhibitor AMG 193 selectively binds to PRMT5 and inhibits its function. By inhibiting its methyltransferase activity, levels of both monomethylated and dimethylated arginine residues in histones H2A, H3 and H4 are decreased. This modulates the expression of genes involved in several cellular processes, including cellular proliferation. This may increase the expression of antiproliferative genes and/or decrease the expression of genes that promote cell proliferation, which may lead to decreased growth of rapidly proliferating cells, including cancer cells. PRMT5, a type II methyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of both omega-N monomethylarginine (MMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (sDMA) on histones and a variety of other protein substrates involved in signal transduction and cellular transcription, is overexpressed in several neoplasms. Elevated levels are associated with decreased patient survival. Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is deleted in certain cancer cells leading to an accumulation of methylthioadenosine (MTA).

Adavosertib selectively targets and inhibits WEE1, a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1, CDC2) to inactivate the CDC2/cyclin B complex. Inhibition of WEE1 activity prevents the phosphorylation of CDC2 and impairs the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. This may lead to apoptosis upon treatment with DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents. Unlike normal cells, most p53 deficient or mutated human cancers lack the G1 checkpoint as p53 is the key regulator of the G1 checkpoint and these cells rely on the G2 checkpoint for DNA repair to damaged cells.

Upon administration of the datopotamab deruxtecan, the anti-TROP2 antibody targets and binds to TROP2 expressed on tumor cells. Upon cellular uptake and lysosomal degradation of the linker, DXd targets and binds to DNA topoisomerase I, thereby stabilizing the cleavable complex between topoisomerase I and DNA, resulting in DNA breaks, inhibition of DNA replication and apoptosis. This inhibits tumor cell proliferation of TROP2-expressing tumor cells. TROP2 is a transmembrane protein overexpressed in various tumors while its expression is low and/or restricted in normal, healthy tissues. Its expression is associated with enhanced tumor aggressiveness, metastasis, drug resistance and increased tumor cell survival. The ADC allows for reduced systemic exposure and enhanced delivery of the cytotoxic agent DXd."

Upon administration, magrolimab selectively binds to CD47 expressed on tumor cells and blocks the interaction of CD47 with its ligand signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPa), a protein expressed on phagocytic cells. This prevents CD47/SIRPa-mediated signaling, allows the activation of macrophages, through the induction of pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by calreticulin, which is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, and results in specific tumor cell phagocytosis. In addition, blocking CD47 signaling activates an anti-tumor T-lymphocyte immune response and T-mediated cell killing. CD47, a tumor associated antigen expressed on normal, healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), is overexpressed on the surface of a variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and interaction with SIRP-alpha, leads to inhibition of macrophages and protects cancer cells from phagocytosis thereby allowing cancer cells to proliferate."

The antinausea and antiemetic effects of this agent appear to be due to the blockade of 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors for serotonin. Although its exact mechanism of action in schizophrenia is unknown, it has been proposed that olanzapine's antipsychotic activity is mediated through antagonism to dopamine D2 receptors with rapid ligand-receptor dissociation kinetics that help to minimize extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).

This prevents CD73-mediated conversion of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine and decreases the amount of free adenosine. This prevents adenosine-mediated lymphocyte suppression and increases the activity of CD8-positive effector cells. This also activates macrophages, and reduces both myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T-lymphocytes. By abrogating the inhibitory effect on the immune system and enhancing the cytotoxic T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells, tumor cell growth decreases. In addition, clustering and internalization of CD73 decreases the migration of cancer cells and prevents metastasis.

Vorinostat, a second generation polar-planar compound, binds to the catalytic domain of the histone deacetylases (HDACs). This allows the hydroxamic moiety to chelate zinc ion located in the catalytic pockets of HDAC, thereby inhibiting deacetylation and leading to an accumulation of both hyperacetylated histones and transcription factors. Hyperacetylation of histone proteins results in the upregulation of the cyclin-dependant kinase p21, followed by G1 arrest. Hyperacetylation of non-histone proteins such as tumor suppressor p53, alpha tubulin, and heat-shock protein 90 produces additional anti-proliferative effects. This agent also induces apoptosis and sensitizes tumor cells to cell death processes. Vorinostat crosses the blood-brain barrier."

This agent shows a favorable toxicity profile in several aspects: it does not generate reactive oxygen species, as do anthracyclines, hence reducing the risk of cardiotoxicity; it is not a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, and thereby evades the common mechanism for multidrug resistance; and it has limited distribution to normal tissues and a more chemically stable molecular structure."
