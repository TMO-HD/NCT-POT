Upon oral administration, A2A/A2B adenosine receptor antagonist INCB106385 competes with tumor-released adenosine for binding to A2AR and A2BR expressed on numerous intra-tumoral immune cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and T-lymphocytes. The binding of INCB106385 to A2AR and A2BR inhibits A2AR/A2BR activity and prevents adenosine-A2AR/A2BR-mediated signaling. A2AR/A2BR inhibition activates and enhances the proliferation of various immune cells, abrogates the adenosine-mediated immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and activates the immune system to exert anti-tumor immune responses against cancer cells, which leads to tumor cell killing. A2AR and A2BR, G protein-coupled signaling receptors, are expressed on the cell surfaces of numerous immune cells. Adenosine is often overproduced by tumor cells and plays a key role in immunosuppression and tumor cell proliferation."

Upon administration, acasunlimab simultaneously targets and binds to 4-1BB, which is expressed on a variety of leukocyte subsets including activated T-lymphocytes, and PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells. Through 4-1BB binding, acasunlimab acts as a conditional 4-1BB agonist, resulting in T-cell co-stimulation and enhances T-lymphocyte-mediated anti-tumor activity. At the same time, acasunlimab prevents PD-L1 from binding to and activating its receptor, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279; programmed death-1). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which may lead to a reduction in tumor growth. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on activated T-cells inhibits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. 4-1BB, a surface glycoprotein of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is an inducible costimulatory receptor that plays a key role in T-cell proliferation, survival and cytolytic activity."

This may increase tumor cell killing and decrease tumor cell proliferation. IL-15 regulates CD8+ T and NK cell development, activation and proliferation. PD-L1, a transmembrane protein, is expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and on many cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1, a negative regulator of the immune system on activated T-cells, limits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion."

Upon administration, LY3415244 simultaneously targets and binds to TIM-3 expressed on certain T-cells, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells. This blocks the interaction of TIM-3 with some of its physiologic ligands and prevents PD-L1 from binding to and activating its receptor, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279; programmed death-1). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which may lead to a reduction in tumor growth. TIM-3, a transmembrane protein and immune checkpoint receptor, is often co-expressed with PD-1 on tumor-antigen-specific T-cells.

The imine groups of the PBD moiety covalently bind to the N2 positions of guanines on opposite strands in the minor groove of DNA. This induces DNA strand breaks, inhibits DNA replication, leads to G2/M cell cycle arrest, induces cell death, and inhibits the proliferation of CLL1-overexpressing tumor cells. CLL1, a transmembrane glycoprotein and member of the C-type lectin/C-type lectin-like domain (CTL/CTLD) superfamily, is overexpressed in leukemic stem cells (LSCs) while absent on normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). It plays an important role in disease progression and relapse of myeloid malignancies."

Upon intravenous administration, anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody NZV930 targets and binds to CD73 on tumor cells, leading to internalization of CD73. This prevents CD73-mediated conversion of extracellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine, thereby preventing adenosine-mediated suppression of lymphocyte activity and increasing the activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). This also activates macrophages and reduces the activity of both myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T-lymphocytes. By abrogating the inhibitory effect on the immune system and enhancing the CTL-mediated immune response against cancer cells, tumor cell growth is decreased. CD73, a plasma membrane protein belonging to the 5'-nucleotidase (NTase) family, is upregulated in many cancer cell types and catalyzes the conversion of extracellular nucleotides, such as AMP, to membrane-permeable nucleosides, such as adenosine; it plays a key role in adenosine-mediated immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment."

Upon subcutaneous (SC) intratumoral (IT) administration of the oncolytic virus CF33-expressing hNIS/anti-PD-L1 antibody, the oncolytic virus specifically infects and replicates in tumor cells causing viral-mediated tumor cell lysis. The released virus particles, in turn, infect and replicate in neighboring tumor cells. Tumor antigens released from the lysed tumor cells also activate the immune system to induce a tumor-specific systemic immune and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, thereby killing nearby non-infected tumor cells. In addition, the anti-PD-L1 antibody produced by the infected tumor cells targets and binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; cluster of differentiation 279; CD279), a transmembrane protein and negative regulator of the immune system, expressed on activated T-cells. This reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling and enhances the CTL-mediated anti-tumor immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells, thereby further killing tumor cells. Upon subsequent administration of certain iodine-containing imaging agents, hNIS expression by the infected tumor cells allows visualization and tracking of viral biodistribution, and analysis and quantification of CF33-infected tumor cells by PET. Also, administration of iodine I 131 results in its uptake by hNIS-expressing tumor cells, which may result in the selective accumulation of a cytotoxic dose of radiation in tumor cells while sparing adjacent normal tissue."

Upon administration of zirconium Zr 89-labeled atezolizumab, the antibody moiety targets and binds to PD-L1. Following tumor cell uptake, the radioisotope moiety can be visualized using PET. This may result in the quantification of PD-L1-expressing tumor cells, an assessment of the expected response to treatment with atezolizumab as well as selection of patients that would respond to atezolizumab.  PD-L1 is overexpressed on many human cancer cell types; PD-L1 binding to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in increased immune evasion."

A third-generation bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid binds to hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone matrix, slowing their dissolution and inhibiting the formation and aggregation of these crystals. This agent also inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, an enzyme involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids, donor substrates of farnesylation and geranylgeranylation during the post-translational modification of small GTPase signalling proteins, which are important in the process of osteoclast turnover. Decreased bone turnover and stabilization of the bone matrix contribute to the analgesic effect of zoledronic acid with respect to painful osteoblastic lesions. The agent also reduces serum calcium concentrations associated with hypercalcemia."

Upon intratumoral administration, cMet CAR-mRNA electroporated autologous T lymphocytes direct T-cells to cMet-expressing tumor cells, which induces a selective toxicity in cMet-expressing tumor cells and causes tumor cell lysis. The 4-1BB co-stimulatory molecule signaling domain enhances activation and signaling after recognition of cMet. The inclusion of the 4-1BB signaling domain may increase the antitumor activity as compared to the inclusion of the CD3-zeta chain alone. The mRNA CAR is expressed for a limited amount of time, which can prevent serious, unforeseen side effects. cMet, a receptor tyrosine kinase overexpressed or mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in cancer cell growth, survival, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis."

Upon oral administration, the p53-HDM2 protein-protein interaction inhibitor MI-773 binds to HDM2, preventing the binding of the HDM2 protein to the transcriptional activation domain of the tumor suppressor protein p53. By preventing this HDM2-p53 interaction, the proteasome-mediated enzymatic degradation of p53 is inhibited and the transcriptional activity of p53 is restored, which may result in the restoration of p53 signaling and lead to the p53-mediated induction of tumor cell apoptosis. HDM2, a zinc finger protein and a negative regulator of the p53 pathway, is often overexpressed in cancer cells. It has been implicated in cancer cell proliferation and survival."
