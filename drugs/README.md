# NCT-POT Drugs

Part of the [**NCT Precision Oncology Thesaurus (NCT-POT)**](https://github.com/TMO-HD/NCT-POT).

## Summary

**NCT POT Drugs** is a data package covering **drug-related information** in the contxt of **precision oncology** workflows. It contains information about drugs, drug classes and drug targets, manufacturers and their drug products (trade names etc.), and approvals and approval-relevant biomarkers and appropriate diagnoses. Information is derived from a number of publicly available [**sources**](NCT_POT_Drugs#Sources_for_Assembly)**,** updated monthly and manually curated by a team of precision oncologists at the [**Divison of Translational Medical Oncology (TMO)**](https://www.dkfz.de/en/translationale-medizinische-onkologie/index.php) **at the** [**National Center for Tumor Diseases in Heidelberg**](https://www.nct-heidelberg.de/)**.** Data can be [**downloaded**](NCT_POT_Drugs#Download) free-of-charge under the [**CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license**](#License) **.**

> :warning: Though striving for best quality, **we cannot guarantee the absence of errors** or the lack of relevant information. The data is intended for application in a scientific context. It **must not be used for clinical decision-making** without decision verification by clinicians with appropriate experience in Â precision oncology.

## Use Cases

NCT-POT Drugs must address frequent use cases like:

| Searching for | Example of request |
| --- | --- |
| **Drugs** | Search for all drugs targeting CLDN18.2, NECTIN4 or KRAS G12C |
| **Trials** | Search for all available clinical trials combining checkpoint inhibitors with FGFR2 inhibitors |
| **Evidence** | Search all available evidence in evidence databases (like CIVIC or OncoKB ) for efficacy of inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in colorectal cancer |
| **Approvals** | Are there drugs approved for NECTIN4-directed therapies in cervical cancer? |
| **Manufacturers** | Search for manufacturers suitable for a trial combining RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway inhibitors with SHP2 inhibitors? |

## Entity relationship model

## Drug classes structure

The drug classes are a hierarchal taxonomy, self-maintained by the TMO  
and focusing on their usage in precision oncology workflows.
